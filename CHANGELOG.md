# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **rest-api**: In-browser authentication ("Method 3") - `POST /auth/vnc/start`,
  `GET /auth/vnc/status`, `POST /auth/vnc/stop`. Spins up a virtual display
  (Xvfb), a real (non-headless) Chrome, and a noVNC web bridge on demand, so a
  full interactive Google login (CAPTCHA/2FA included) can be completed from
  any browser, without a local Chrome install or copying `secrets.json`
  around. See `AUTHENTICATION.md`.
- **rest-api**: The running service picks up a successful VNC login
  immediately - if it started without valid credentials, it re-initializes
  itself as soon as login succeeds, no container restart needed. (Left alone
  if it was already authenticated, to avoid starting a second background
  location updater.)

### Fixed

- **rest-api**: `KeyError: 'Auth'` (Google rejecting a revoked/expired token)
  surfaced as a bare, confusing exception in both the device-list and
  location-fetch paths. Now raises a clear message pointing at
  re-authenticating.
- **rest-api**: A request to `/api/v1/devices` (or the background location
  updater) made while a VNC login was in progress used to independently
  trigger its own unattended, un-completable headless login attempt and hang
  for up to 5 minutes. Now returns `409` immediately instead.
- **rest-api**: The VNC login flow used to unconditionally clear the cached
  auth token before every attempt, so an aborted or interrupted session (tab
  closed, session timeout, explicit stop) could leave a previously-working
  container unable to authenticate at all. The old token is now only replaced
  once a new one is confirmed working.
- **rest-api**: `patch_chrome_driver.py` no longer matched the current
  upstream `chrome_driver.py` (library drift) - two of its three patches were
  silently no-ops. Rewritten with smaller, more resilient anchors.
- **rest-api**: `pkill -f chrome` (a "kill stale Chrome" precaution in
  upstream's `create_driver()`) was found to hang indefinitely in this
  container environment, unrelated to matching anything - removed, since a
  fresh on-demand Xvfb session never has a stale Chrome to kill anyway.
- **rest-api**: Orphaned `chromedriver`/`chromium` processes from the VNC flow
  weren't being reaped (the app runs as PID 1, which must reap re-parented
  orphans itself) - added `tini` as the real PID 1.
- **rest-api**: `/health`'s unhealthy message and `/`'s endpoint list now
  mention the VNC login option; the VNC-driven Chrome window is maximized and
  undecorated (fills the whole noVNC view); `noVNC`'s bare web root now serves
  `vnc.html` instead of a directory listing.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- **rest-api**: The `/` root endpoint and the OpenAPI docs (`/docs`) reported a
  hardcoded `"version": "1.0.0"` regardless of the actual image tag being run.
  The version is now injected at build time via `--build-arg APP_VERSION` (set
  automatically from the git tag by `build-and-push.sh` and the GitHub Actions
  workflow) and read from the `APP_VERSION` env var at runtime, so it always
  matches the published image tag.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **rest-api**: Fixed a race in the patched FCM receiver (`patch_fcm_receiver.py`) where
  `_listening` was never set to `True` after connecting, causing a new MCS connection to
  be opened for every single device on every background location update cycle. This led
  to overlapping listener tasks, `readexactly()` race errors, and location requests
  timing out for whichever device was in flight when the connection collapsed.
- **rest-api**: `/api/v1/devices` no longer crashes with a confusing
  `fromhex() argument must be str, not None` when Google's Nova API rejects a request
  (e.g. expired/revoked auth token). It now raises a clear, actionable error instead.
- **rest-api**: `/health` no longer reports `200 healthy` when authentication isn't
  actually configured. `get_username()` can silently return an empty string instead of
  raising, so a missing/invalid `secrets.json` used to pass as "verified". `/health` now
  returns `503` with a `{"status": "unhealthy", "message": "..."}` body describing the
  real cause, and the app no longer crash-loops on a failed startup so the reason stays
  visible.
- **rest-api/build-and-push.sh**: New script to build and push the Docker image without
  ever baking `secrets.json` into it (temporarily set aside during the build, restored
  after). Also disables buildx provenance/SBOM attestations (`--provenance=false
  --sbom=false`), since the attestation manifest they add was preventing Synology
  Container Manager from detecting new image versions.
- **homeassistant-integration**: `sensor.py` and `device_tracker.py` only created
  entities once, at integration setup time, for whatever devices/data existed in that
  exact moment. A device without a location or battery reading yet (e.g. right after a
  REST API restart) would never get its tracker/battery sensor, ever. Both platforms now
  use a coordinator listener to add entities dynamically as data becomes available.
- **homeassistant-integration**: Re-pairing a tracker (e.g. after a battery change)
  makes Google issue a new `device_id` for the same physical device. Home Assistant
  never prunes devices on its own, so the old `device_id` lingered forever as a
  duplicate, unavailable device. `__init__.py` now removes stale devices (and their
  entities) from the registry on setup/reload.
- **rest-api/docker-compose.portainer.yml**: New compose file for Portainer deployments
  that pulls the published image (`image:`) instead of building from source, with
  `secrets.json` mounted from the NAS filesystem rather than baked into the image.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed

- **Dockerfile**: Replaced Google Chrome with Chromium for ARM64 compatibility
  - Issue: Google Chrome only provides amd64 packages, causing build failures on Apple Silicon Macs
  - Solution: Use Chromium which supports both amd64 and arm64 architectures
  - Impact: Docker build now works on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel Macs
  - Added environment variables: `CHROME_BIN` and `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH`

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-30

### Fixed

- **Dockerfile**: Fixed Google Chrome installation by replacing deprecated `apt-key` with modern GPG keyring method

  - Issue: `apt-key` command is no longer available in newer Debian/Ubuntu versions
  - Solution: Use `gpg --dearmor` and signed-by in sources.list
  - Impact: Docker build now works on all modern systems

- **docker-compose.yml**: Removed obsolete `version` attribute
  - Issue: Docker Compose v2 shows warning about obsolete version attribute
  - Solution: Removed `version: '3.8'` line
  - Impact: No more warnings during build/run
